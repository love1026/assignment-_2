          Teacher, poet—and husband—Joseph Prendergast re-joins Paris Café
          Writing after finishing a teaching gig in China. The group is limited
          to eight writers. The week starts with a walking tour in the Marais
          where Patricia and Joseph live and where the seminar is centered. The
          morning workshops are filled with lively conversations, techniques,
          and writing prompts. The sessions are positive, designed to get you
          writing more—and even better—each day. No formal writing experience is
          necessary; we are experienced and gentle with newcomers. We also have
          long success working with and editing professional writers. The focus
          is creative nonfiction writing. This means writing about real people,
          real places, and really good food. However, compelling nonfiction is
          also storytelling, so during the week we do venture into fiction to
          reinforce that skill. Work on your personal memoir, a new freelance
          article, or an idea for a historical novel.
